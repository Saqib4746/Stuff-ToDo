# Stuff-ToDo

I built a simple yet functional ToDo App named Stuff ToDo in HTML CSS and Java Script  where you can:

✍️ Enter and add tasks

🗑️ Delete tasks

✏️ Edit tasks

📊 Track progress with a dynamic progress bar

🔢 See the live counter of tasks added & completed

The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
